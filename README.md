MemBoard is a lightweight React + Vite app that lets creators connect their wallet or Memory ID to visualize how their data connects across the web, and how much $MEM they could earn when apps query that data. Itâ€™s a starter example showing how the Memory Protocol API can power transparent, user-owned data dashboards in creator ecosystems.
